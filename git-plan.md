# Git strategy questions
1. Do I use git branches or not to help separate things? As each project should be a unique folder, having branches while good general
   policy, might just create extra work.
2. gitignore file, what should be in it?
3. Where should I track any video files and the like? They're going to be too big to reasonably contain within a github repo.
